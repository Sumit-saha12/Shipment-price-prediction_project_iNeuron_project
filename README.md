# Problem Statement:

The market for supply chain analytics is expected to develop at a CAGR of 17.3 percent
from 2019 to 2024, more than doubling in size. This data demonstrates how supply
chain organizations are understanding the advantages of being able to predict what will
happen in the future with a decent degree of certainty. Supply chain leaders may use
this data to address supply chain difficulties, cut costs, and enhance service levels all at
the same time.

# Main Goal:

The main goal is to predict the supply chain shipment pricing based on the available
factors in the dataset.

# Approach:

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.
